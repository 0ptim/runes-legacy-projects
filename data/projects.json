To qualify for the airdrop, owners needed to have three inscriptions in block 826,600, with specific format exclusions.\n\nThis groundbreaking project not only showcases the capabilities of digital art on the blockchain but also provides a unique opportunity for collectors and enthusiasts to be part of a historic moment in cryptocurrency.",

Our project begins with Bitcoin Burials, a collection of 10k pixel-art headstones, each marking a false prediction of Bitcoin's end. This series not only showcases Bitcoin's durability but also humorously notes the frequent misjudgments of its demise.\n\nThe narrative deepens with our 10k Boneys collection, where playful, mischievous skeletons, arising from the very criticisms that sought to bury Bitcoin, symbolize the community's enduring spirit and collective defiance against skepticism.\n\nAdding to the allure, we have collaborated on both Bitcoin Burials and Boneys with the artist who gave you Bitcoin Frogs. This partnership ensures the continuation of distinctive, engaging art that has already captured the community's imagination.\n\nThe uniqueness of our project extends into the realm of rune mining. That can be achieved by collectors pairing their Boneys with Burials, offering an immersive, engaging experience. Here, the synergy between Boneys and their corresponding Burials becomes crucial: pairs with rare traits or where the Boney emerged from its specific corresponding Burial enhance mining multipliers, deepening the connection between collector actions and Bitcoin's history.\n\nBy integrating distinctive traits from both collections, we emphasize not just the narrative depth but also the strategic engagement required in the rune mining process. This system encourages collectors to explore the intertwining stories of their Boneys and Burials, promoting a richer, more interactive community experience rooted in the lore and resilience of Bitcoin.",

This innovative game blends strategy and chance across blockchain technology, allowing players to engage with their \"gobs\" in a unique and interactive way. Starting at block 836144, GOB invites players to participate in a thrilling journey of re-inscribing the word \"gob\" onto their ordinal, risking their gobs for potential high rewards, or choosing a safer path by doing nothing and watching their gobs multiply. With hints at a connection to the intriguing MIME token and strategies that revolve around the timing of your actions, GOB offers an exciting new adventure for blockchain enthusiasts and gamers alike.\n\nGame of Blocks (GOB) Summary:\n1. Gameplay Start: Begins at block 836144.\n2. Phase 1 Duration: 8 tiers, each 144 blocks long, totaling 1,152 blocks (~1 week).\n3. Actions: Players can either re-inscribe 'gob' on their ordinal or do nothing.\n- Re-inscribing: Risks gob being frozen or dying. Odds of freezing improve each tier.\n- Do Nothing: Gobs split, doubling at the end of each tier.\n4. Phase 1 Outcome:\n- If re-inscribing wins, gob freezes and doesn't split further.\n- Doing nothing leads to 256 gobs on an ordinal by the end.\n5. MIME Yield: Related to gob tier; higher yield for lower tiers. Starts at 42,690,000 for genesis tier, roughly halves each tier.\n6. Strategy: Aim for lower tier to secure higher MIME yield, involves risk.\n\nCheck out their Documentation down below to dive into the details.",
